HELLO again welcome to my world 
TERMINAL ipconfig/all 
check CMD commands on google 
check dir to see the folders you have if you have DESKtop available or just Onedrive. 
If we have One drive only then we apply: cd C:\Users\brill\OneDrive\Desktop 
also with cd.. you can access Onedrive and after you can type cd Desktop and it takes you to cd Desktop 
to use bash you type ls 
print working directory pwd on both bash and cmd

to see folders on bash we type ls -f 
in bash to clear stuff type clear 
for windows we haveto type cls 

in the case of being able to go back and forward we only press the key up to go back and down to go forward. 


ls --help 

cd stands for CHANGE DIRECTORY.   so if we want to access to a specific file we type cd Business Presentation or whatever the name of the folder and we access 
the file. we can inspect the file with dir 
To go back we type cd .. 
Also it applies  cd ../../
cd Desktop




mkdir means make a directory so it will be mkdir followed by the name for example thesis. 


to create a file inside the folder thesis we type nano draft.txt



To write inside the note we type on cmd notepad test.txt or echo test.txt 


 we can do this to type something inside        >echo > testing.txt


we want to be able to movel file with cmd so we need to we have current location and what is going to be my target location??
